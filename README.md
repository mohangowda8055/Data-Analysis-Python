## Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
### Business Problem:
In recent years, City hotel and Resort hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with issues as result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates in both hotels is the primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
### Objective:
The objective of this data analysis is to gain insights and understand the factors influencing booking cancellations, which could help hotel management and booking platforms to optimize their operations, reduce cancellation rates and identify potential opportunities for improving booking management and customer experience.
### Assumptions:
1. The dataset provides accurate and reliable information about hotel bookings and cancellations.
2. The reasons for cancellations are not explicitly provided, but we may infer some patterns based on the data available.
3. We assume that the data sample used for analysis is representative of entire population of entire bookings.
4. The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of revenue is booking cancellations.
### Research Questions:
1. Booking Types: What are the proportions of bookings for each hotel type(city hotel vs resort hotel)? How do booking patterns differ betweeen the two types of hotels?
2. Booking Patterns and Seasonality: What are the seasonal booking trends for hotels? Are there specific months or periods with higher booking cancellations?
3. Lead Time and Booking Length: How do lead times(the time between booking and check-in) and booking lengths(durations of stay) impact booking cacellations?

10. Cancellation Analysis: What are the main reasons for booking cancellations? Are there any specific patterns or trends associated with cancellations?
11. Booking Lead Time Optimization: Based on the analysis, can we recommend strategies to optimize booking lead time and minimize cancellations?
### Hypothesis:
1. Null Hypothesis: The cancellation rate for city hotel bookings is same as the cancellation rate for resort hotel bookings.
2. Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the number of hotel bookings across different seasons.
3. Null Hypothesis: More cancellations not occur when ADR is higher.
4. Null Hypothesis: More cancellations not occur when lead time is less.
5. Null Hypothesis: Both cancelled and confirmed reservation has same ratio for no. of nights.
6. Null Hypothesis: The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.
7. Null Hypothesis: Cancelled reservations are assigned with the same room type as they reserved.
8. Null Hypothesis: The majority of clients reserve room without any deposit.
9. Null Hypothesis: When there is no longer waiting list, customers do not tend to cancel more frequently.
10. Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between customer type and reservation.
11. Null Hypothesis: Reservations that are repeated are the most.
12. Null Hypothesis: Customers with previous cancellations tend to cancel the most.
13. Null Hypothesis: Agents have more no. of cancellations.
14. Null Hypothesis: Most of the cancellations are done on the arrival day.
15. Null Hypothesis: Countries have different frequency of cancellation.
### Suggestions:
1. As compared to Resort hotels City hotels have higher cancellation rate and in the month of January cancellations are even more. So, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with new year environment that can attract the customers.
2. Cancellation rates are higher when prices are higher, in city hotels prices do not vary much, prices should vary according to seasons or demand. In order to prevent cancellations of reservation, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. 
3. In particular to Resort hotels, cancellations are higher when ADR is higher throughout the year, cancellations can be reduced in Resort hotels by reducing the prices.
4. Only 3.2% of previous customers reserved again in same hotel, and most of them cancelled the reservation. So, should increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate. They can also provide discounts to previous customers.
5. Reservation with higher lead time tends cancel the most, so hotels should allow customers to reserve room with shorter lead time.
6. Cancellations are more, when customers reserve room without any deposits and cancellations or no-show are higher on the arrival day. In order avoid cancellations and vacant rooms, hotels need to make customers reserve room with some deposit.
7. More no. of reservations are with 2 peoples, mostly couples. Hotels should provide services according to type of customers.
